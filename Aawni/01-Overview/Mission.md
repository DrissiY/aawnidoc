Aawni’s mission is to empower individuals and households across Morocco by making it easy, safe, and transparent to find trusted local help for everyday tasks—while creating a path for informal workers to access consistent income, formalize their status, and build sustainable careers.

  

We are committed to:

- Connecting clients with skilled taskers in a few simple clicks.
    
- Ensuring a reliable and secure service experience through verified profiles, reviews, and clear expectations.
    
- Encouraging the professionalization of informal labor by rewarding verified taskers with greater visibility and access to in-app benefits.
    
- Providing digital tools and support to help workers transition into the formal economy (such as guidance on becoming auto-entrepreneurs).
    
- Partnering with local institutions, communities, and public programs to extend access and impact across all regions of Morocco.
    

  

At the heart of Aawni is the belief that **economic empowerment begins with access**—access to clients, to visibility, to credibility, and to work that brings dignity. We are not just building a platform—we are building a movement to uplift local talent, modernize household services, and drive inclusive growth across the country.
