The name **“Aawni” (عاوني)** comes from **Moroccan Darija** and simply means “**Help me**.” It reflects the core purpose of the platform: to make it easier for people to **ask for help** and for others to **offer their help** with dignity and reliability. It’s a familiar, warm, and culturally rooted word that instantly resonates with Moroccan users, whether they are clients seeking assistance or workers offering their skills.

  

The **logo** features a **hand symbol**, which serves a double meaning:

- On one side, it represents the classic idea of a **helping hand**—support, reliability, and human connection.
    
- On the other, it evokes the idea of **hands-on work**, highlighting the **manual, local, and service-based** nature of the tasks offered through the platform.
    

  

This simple but powerful symbol bridges technology with trust, informality with professionalism, and local culture with modern tools—exactly what Aawni stands for.
