Aawni envisions a future where finding help for everyday tasks is no longer a source of stress or uncertainty, and where informal workers across Morocco are empowered to step into the formal economy with dignity, visibility, and opportunity. In a country where a large percentage of domestic and manual labor still operates outside regulatory frameworks, we see a clear path forward: a trusted digital platform that creates transparency, improves livelihoods, and builds bridges between communities and the growing digital economy.

  

Our long-term vision is to become Morocco’s leading hub for verified, on-demand service providers—starting with cleaning and expanding to plumbing, electrical work, assembly, moving, smart home setup, and more. We imagine a world where every home can open their door to a tasker with confidence, knowing their experience, reviews, and status are clearly visible and verifiable. And where every tasker, regardless of education or economic background, has the tools to access a consistent flow of clients, manage their work, receive fair compensation, and eventually formalize their professional status.

  

We believe that digital inclusion can drive social and economic inclusion. By combining intuitive design with strategic verification systems, educational support, and collaboration with public institutions, Aawni doesn’t just aim to match workers with clients—we aim to redefine how people work, earn, and live in a modern Moroccan society.

  

Our vision is not only about convenience or technology—it’s about **creating a cultural shift**, where informal labor is no longer invisible, and where dignity, trust, and opportunity are accessible to all.
