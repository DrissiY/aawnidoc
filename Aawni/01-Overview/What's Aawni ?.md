Aawni is a Moroccan digital platform designed to simplify access to trusted local help for everyday tasks such as cleaning, plumbing, repairs, painting, and more. Built with accessibility and inclusion at its core, Aawni aims to empower both clients and independent workers—especially those operating informally—by creating a transparent, secure, and efficient environment for service exchange.

In Morocco, many individuals in need of help still rely on informal networks, word-of-mouth, or unverified sources to find assistance, often leading to delays, unreliability, or safety concerns. On the other side, thousands of capable workers struggle to find consistent clients, lack formal work opportunities, and remain outside the tax and social systems due to the informal nature of their jobs.


Aawni bridges this gap by offering a user-friendly platform where individuals can describe their needs, browse tasker profiles, and book services confidently. Anyone can sign up as a tasker, but those who complete a background check and register as auto-entrepreneurs receive a special “Verified” badge—highlighting them as reliable, officially recognized professionals. Clients are clearly informed about each tasker’s status and are free to choose accordingly, taking full responsibility for their decision.

  
Beyond the marketplace, Aawni’s mission is to support Morocco’s shift toward a more inclusive and formalized economy by encouraging taskers to professionalize their status, providing visibility, opportunity, and a path to long-term sustainability.
